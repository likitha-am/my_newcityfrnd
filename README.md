# MyNewFrnd – Your Trusted City Companion

MyNewFrnd is a web-based platform built to help people who are relocating to a new city.
It connects users with trusted local guides called CityMates and provides in-app support to make settling into a new city easier, safer, and less stressful.
This project focuses on clean UI, smooth user flow, and real-world features like authentication and real-time chat.

## Problem
People moving to new cities often struggle with finding safe accommodation,
understanding neighborhoods, and accessing essential services.

## Solution
MyNewFrnd provides personalized, city-specific support by connecting users
with CityMates and AI-powered assistance.

## Key Features

CityMate Chat Feature (New)

MyNewFrnd includes a one-to-one real-time chat system that allows tourists to directly communicate with their selected CityMate. Once a CityMate is chosen from the dashboard, users are redirected to a dedicated chat interface where messages are exchanged securely and instantly.

Each conversation is uniquely identified using a chat ID generated from the tourist and CityMate details, ensuring private and isolated communication. The chat functionality is powered by Firebase Firestore, enabling real-time message updates and persistent storage.

## Chat Highlights

- Tourist ↔ CityMate private chat
- Real-time messaging using Firebase Firestore

- Unique chat sessions per guide
- Clean and simple chat UI
This feature brings real-world interaction to the platform and simulates how modern relocation and service platforms enable direct communication between users and service providers.
